### Ideas 

1. Add more levels, at least 10 of them.
	Different landscape (hills, islands, stairs, vicious circles)
	Different landscape textures: 
		- dirt + grass, 
		- rocks, 
		- sand + sand stone,
		- snow + ice,

2. Implenet slightly different physics: 
	less wheel friction on ice and sand, 
	more friction on rocks

3. Player sholud be rewarded. 
	- The higher jump - the bigger reward (10 or 20 coins)
	- Ability to choose different player skins?

4. Introduce new mechanics: nitro

4. How about levels with inverse gravity?

5. Add menu to choose a level, to tweak sound effects

6. Learn how to build a game: how to create a standalone exe or WebGL build

### TODO:
- Add parallax background to Level 2
- Add funny sign before an abyss between islands
