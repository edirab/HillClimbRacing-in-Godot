### Ideas 

1. Add more levels, at least 10 of them.
	Different landscape 
	(
		+ hills, 
		+ islands, 
		stairs, 
		+ vicious circles, 
		tunnels - do not jump too high!
	)
	
	Different landscape textures: 
		+ dirt + grass, 
		- rocks, 
		- sand + sand stone,
		- snow + ice,
		- city: highway + buildings on a background

2. Implenet slightly different physics: 
	less wheel friction on ice and sand, 
	more friction on rocks

3. Coin pickups may sound different: the heavier coin, the lower sound.
	We can vuild simple melodies with this technique

3. Player sholud be rewarded. 
	- The higher jump - the bigger reward (10 or 20 coins)
	- Ability to choose different player skins?

4. Introduce new mechanics: 
	+ nitro -> passing vicious circles, long jumps
	- portals and multilevel terrains

4. How about levels with inverse gravity?

5. Add menu to choose a level, to tweak sound effects

6. Learn how to build a game: how to create a standalone exe or WebGL build

### TODO:
- Add funny sign before an abyss between islands
- Add more coins: 10, 15 and 25 cents
- Animate Nitro pickup (disappearing)
- Fill Level 3 with coins
- Add sound to level completed message

### Done
+ Add parallax background to Level 2
+ Add Nitro
